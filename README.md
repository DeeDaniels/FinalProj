This is the repo of my final project. It is a draft right now, but I will update as it evolves into it's final form.

# Concepts/Optomization:
-a website that acts as an internet video editor: user can put in multiple links from videos on youtube or video files online and can see them broken up in an online video workshop. 
- the video samples can be customized letting the user choose which segments of the video to sample (Being able to isolate from 0:02 seconds - 0:12 seconds of a video)
- I need to register for the Youtube API & add that feature to the back end of this.
